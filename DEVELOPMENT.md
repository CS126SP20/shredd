# Development

---
- **4/18/20** Added Box2D
   - Still need to figure out how to use it
   - Decided not to use PretzelGui (for now) and just use Cinder's GUI
- **4/19/20** Add blocks class, add function declarations in snake_app
   - Need to add code to the blocks class to work
   - Need to figure out how to draw shapes from Box2D in Cinder
- **4/20/20** Add code to Blocks class, try to allow user to control using keys
   - ~~Still need to figure out how to successfully move blocks (not reacting right now)~~
   - Try to find out how to draw Box2D objects in Cinder
     - Figured out how to draw using Cinder functions, but want to see if there is a equivalent function for Box2D
   - Get objects to move, but want to have blocks interact
     - Make it so pushing one block will push the other one if they are in contact
   - ~~Need to figure out how to put walls on either side of the window~~
- **4/21/20** Create/draw walls on boundary of screen
   - Still need to find out how to draw Box2D objects more effectively
   - Should find a way to detect the collisions instead of using magic numbers
- **4/26/20** Fix units to allow blocks to move faster
   - ~~Still need to figure out spikes~~
   - Tried changing the colors/background to make more visually pleasing
   - Not sure what to do about the gap between the two blocks
- **4/27/20** Add spike graphics but need to fix details
   - Add spike graphics in my_app.cc
   - To do:
     - [ ] Figure out why blocks have gap
     - [ ] Make block movements less sensitive
     - [ ] Figure out why DrawSpikes() changes the color of the background
     - [ ] Detect collisions still
     - [ ] Add score/leaderboard
